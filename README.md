# Prototype with Tailwind CSS

## Commands

- `npm run build`
- `npm run watch`
- `npm run build --production` (to purge tailwind's unused css with purgecss)

## Local Server

- `npm -g live-server` to install live server globally
- `live-server public` (run from 'public directory' to view the site locally)

## Tailwind's example config file

- `npx tailwind init tailwind-full.config.js --full` generates a 'full' tailwind config file. This is useful if you want to see tailwind's default configs.
